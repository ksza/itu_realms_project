\subsection{Application Development Systems} % (fold)
\label{sub:application_development_systems}
In this subsection we will describe some application development systems. These systems provide an abstraction to app development and so they, in some way, seek to target some of the same users as our proposed idea.

\subsection{Taxanomy of Location Features} % (fold)
\label{sub:taxanomy_of_location_features}
In this subsection we will try to create a taxonomy for location based features. Using the before described location based apps, we will try to factor out commonalities and abstract them to be able to describe them as general location based features.
