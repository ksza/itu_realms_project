With the rise in numbers of smart phones equipped with location-sensing technologies, location-based applications have become increasingly popular and are found in numbers around the mobile phone application marketplaces. Location-based application use the physical location of the user to allow for now way of interacting with software or with other people.
\\\\
To further push location-based systems in to every day use, we present an end-user programming system - Realms - that allows users to augment physical locations with digital information. With Realms, users can augment physical location with information through a web-interface based using a simple map. The information is thereafter available on a mobile phone application.

We describe our motivations, design rationale and implementation of the system and present a preliminary evaluation based on a test with 9 users. This evaluation showed that the participants found the system useful and easy to use and pointed us in a direction for future work.
