\subsection{Agumented Spaces} % (fold)
\label{sub:agumented_spaces}
The main functionality of our proposed system is the ability to create augmented physical spaces. In this subsection we will explore related works on augmented spaces. A very interesting field is location based games as described in the research literature.
