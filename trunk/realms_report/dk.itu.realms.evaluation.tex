\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec.eval}
In this section we will describe our evaluation of the realms system.

\subsection{Configuration Manager Evaluation} % (fold)
\label{sub:configuration_manager_evaluation}
We will evaluate the configuration manager with users - preferably with knowledge of app but not necessarily with programming experience. The evaluation should focus on usefulness and usability

\subsection{Android Application Evaluation} % (fold)
\label{sub:android_application_evaluation}
While the main focus for realms is the creation of realms through the configuration manager, we should still evaluate the Android application for accessing realms. We will try to evaluate the app by creating a few configurations and have users explore these realms.
