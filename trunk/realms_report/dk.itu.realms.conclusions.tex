\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec.conclusions}
In this report we presented the Realms system - a system for augmenting physical locations with digital information. Our motivation behind the system was to create end-user programming support for location-based applications, and our objective was to explore the design space - especially the tradeoffs between the usability and the expressiveness of the system. 
\\\\
We presented an analysis of location-based systems and came up with a taxonomy to describe these systems. We then presented our design motivations behind Realms and described the implementation of the two components that make up the system; the configurator and the mobile client.
\\\\
Last we conducted an evaluation with 9 participants that each tried both of the system components. The participants found the system useful and easy to use and came up with a lot suggestions for future work. The most requested features were push-based communication, hints regarding marker placement, and support for more marker types. We will use these results to drive future work on the system and prepare it for an evaluation with participants without programming experience.
